## Project 
- [Holiday Package Prediction (On-Progress)](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhy/Holiday-Package-Prediction)

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and is titled "Holiday Package Prediction". A notable issue with this data is that only 18% of the customers purchased the packages. The goal of this project is to understand why this is happening and how to improve sales.


- [E-Commerce Shipping Data (Hexa Avengers)](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Hexa-Avengers--E-Commerce-Shipping-Data.git)

This project, undertaken as the final task at Rakamin Academy, was completed within a group named Hexa Avengers, consisting of 6 members. I served as the Project Leader, and our team achieved recognition as the Best Final Project Team.

The primary objective of this project was to reduce the percentage of late rates by implementing machine learning classification techniques and identifying suitable business recommendations.

The project encompassed several key processes, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Modeling, and Business Simulation, allowing us to generate appropriate business recommendations.

The project is implemented using Python and used dataset sourced from Kaggle.

- [Predict Customer Clicked Ads Classification by Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Using-Machine-Learning.git)

A company based in Indonesia is seeking to assess the effectiveness of its broadcasted advertisements. Understanding the success of these marketing efforts is crucial for attracting customers and optimizing the impact of the advertisements. By analyzing historical advertisement data and extracting insights and patterns, the company aims to gain valuable information for setting marketing targets.

The primary objective of this case is to develop a machine learning classification model. This model is designed to identify and classify the right target customers, allowing the company to optimize its marketing strategy. Through the analysis of historical data, the goal is to create a predictive model that can efficiently determine the likelihood of customer engagement with the advertisements. This, in turn, will enable the company to tailor its marketing efforts to reach the most receptive audience, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of its advertising campaigns.

The project is implemented using Python and used dataset sourced from Rakamin Academy.

- [Improving Employee Retention By Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Improving-Employee-Retention-By-Predicting-Employee-Attrition-Using-Machine-Learning.git)

Human resources (HR) represent the fundamental assets that require effective management for the company to achieve its business goals efficiently. In this context, we are addressing a challenge related to human resources within the company. This project's primary objective is to understand how to retain employees within the current organization, recognizing that turnover incurs increased costs for employee recruitment and training, especially for those who have recently joined. Identifying the key factors contributing to employee dissatisfaction allows the company to proactively address these issues by implementing targeted programs that directly tackle employee concerns.

The project is implemented using Python and used dataset sourced from Rakamin Academy.


- [Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL.git)

Within a company, the measurement of business performance plays a crucial role in tracking, monitoring, and evaluating the success or failure of diverse business processes. Consequently, this project aims to analyze the business performance of an eCommerce company, considering several key metrics such as customer growth, product quality, and payment types.

The project is implemented using PostgreSQL and used dataset sourced from Rakamin Academy.

- [Investigate Hotel Business Using Data Visualization](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Investigate-Hotel-Business-Using-Data-Visualization.git)

As data scientists, our responsibility is to unveil insights related to business performance, especially in this project about the domain of business hotels. This can be accomplished through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and subsequently, visualizing the discovered patterns and trends using graph representations. The primary focus of this project is to understand how customers behave when making hotel reservations and to explore the relationship between customer behavior and the rate of hotel reservation cancellations.

The project is implemented using Python and used dataset sourced from Rakamin Academy.

- [Predict Customer Personality To Boost Marketing Campaign By Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kevinusmayadhyw/Predict-Customer-Personality-To-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-By-Using-Machine-Learning.git)

Understanding the personality and behavior of customers is crucial for a company's rapid development. This knowledge enables the provision of improved services and benefits to customers, fostering loyalty. Leveraging historical marketing campaign data for performance enhancement and targeted customer engagement is a valuable strategy. In this project, the focus is on creating a cluster prediction model, utilizing insights from historical data to facilitate informed decision-making for the company.

The project is implemented using Python and used dataset sourced from Rakamin Academy.
