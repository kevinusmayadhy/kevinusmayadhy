This project, undertaken as the final task at Rakamin Academy, was completed within a group named Hexa Avengers, consisting of 6 members. I served as the Project Leader, and our team achieved recognition as the Best Final Project Team.

The primary objective of this project was to reduce the percentage of late rates by implementing machine learning classification techniques and identifying suitable business recommendations.

The project encompassed several key processes, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Modeling, and Business Simulation, allowing us to generate appropriate business recommendations.
